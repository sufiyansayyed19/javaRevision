    "# PHASE 0 – Mindset & Java Execution Basics\n",
    "\n",
    "## Purpose of Phase 0\n",
    "\n",
    "Reset your Java foundation so that:\n",
    "\n",
    "* You understand how Java actually runs\n",
    "* You don’t treat Java as “just syntax”\n",
    "* Interview answers become logical, not memorized\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "## 1) What Exactly Happens When You Run a Java Program?\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step-by-step Flow\n",
    "\n",
    "1. You write a `.java` file\n",
    "2. Compiler (`javac`) converts it to **bytecode** (`.class`)\n",
    "3. JVM executes the bytecode\n",
    "4. JVM handles:\n",
    "\n",
    "   * Memory\n",
    "   * Security\n",
    "   * Optimization\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Point:**\n",
    "Java is **compiled + interpreted**, not purely either.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2) JDK vs JRE vs JVM (Very Important)\n",
    "\n",
    "### JVM (Java Virtual Machine)\n",
    "\n",
    "* Executes bytecode\n",
    "* Platform dependent\n",
    "* Handles memory management and garbage collection\n",
    "\n",
    "### JRE (Java Runtime Environment)\n",
    "\n",
    "* JVM + core libraries\n",
    "* Needed to **run** Java programs\n",
    "\n",
    "### JDK (Java Development Kit)\n",
    "\n",
    "* JRE + compiler + development tools\n",
    "* Needed to **develop** Java programs\n",
    "\n",
    "**Interview Line:**\n",
    "JDK ⊃ JRE ⊃ JVM\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3) Why Java Is Platform Independent\n",
    "\n",
    "* Java source code is compiled into bytecode\n",
    "* Bytecode runs on any JVM\n",
    "* JVM is platform dependent, Java code is not\n",
    "\n",
    "Hence:\n",
    "**“Write once, run anywhere”**\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",

    "## 4) main() Method – Why It Looks Strange\n",
    "\n",
    "```java\n",
    "public static void main(String[] args)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Breakdown\n",
    "\n",
    "* `public` → JVM must access it\n",
    "* `static` → no object creation needed\n",
    "* `void` → JVM does not expect a return value\n",
    "* `String[] args` → command-line arguments\n",
    "\n",
    "**Interview Trap:**\n",
    "`main` can be overloaded, but JVM only calls this exact signature.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 5) Memory Basics (Foundation Only)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Stack Memory\n",
    "\n",
    "* Method calls\n",
    "* Local variables\n",
    "* Faster\n",
    "* Follows LIFO\n",
    "\n",
    "### Heap Memory\n",
    "\n",
    "* Objects\n",
    "* Instance variables\n",
    "* Shared across methods\n",
    "\n",
    "For now, just remember this.\n",
    "We will go deep later.\n",

    "\n",
    "## 6) Java Version Reality (Interview-Oriented)\n",
    "\n",
    "You do not need to memorize all Java versions.\n",
    "\n",
    "What matters:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Core Java concepts (Java 8+ mindset)\n",
    "* OOP\n",
    "* Collections\n",
    "* Basic Streams\n",
    "\n",
    "Interviewers test **understanding**, not version history.\n",

    "## 7) Java in Interviews vs Java in DSA\n",
    "\n",
    "### Interviews\n",
    "\n",
    "* Concept clarity\n",
    "* “Why” questions\n",
    "* OOP depth\n",
    "\n",
    "### DSA\n",
    "\n",
    "* Speed\n",
    "* Clean logic\n",
    "* Correct data structure usage\n",
    "\n",
    "This roadmap balances both.\n",

    "\n",
    "## Phase 0 Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "You should now be clear about:\n",
    "\n",
    "* How Java runs\n",
    "* JVM vs JRE vs JDK\n",
    "* Platform independence\n",
    "* Role of `main`\n",
    "* Stack vs Heap (intro)\n",
    "* Java’s role in interviews and DSA\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Phase 0 – Exercises (Mandatory)\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Why is Java not 100% compiled?\n",
    "2. Why must `main` be static?\n",
    "3. Can Java run without JVM?\n",
    "4. Difference between JDK and JRE?\n",
    "5. Where are objects stored?\n",
