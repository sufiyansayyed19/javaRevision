# PHASE 0 – Mindset & Java Execution Basics

## Purpose of Phase 0

Reset your Java foundation so that:

* You understand how Java actually runs
* You don’t treat Java as “just syntax”
* Interview answers become logical, not memorized

---

## 1) What Exactly Happens When You Run a Java Program?

### Step-by-step Flow

1. You write a `.java` file
2. Compiler (`javac`) converts it to **bytecode** (`.class`)
3. JVM executes the bytecode
4. JVM handles:

   * Memory
   * Security
   * Optimization

**Key Point:**
Java is **compiled + interpreted**, not purely either.

---

## 2) JDK vs JRE vs JVM (Very Important)

### JVM (Java Virtual Machine)

* Executes bytecode
* Platform dependent
* Handles memory management and garbage collection

### JRE (Java Runtime Environment)

* JVM + core libraries
* Needed to **run** Java programs

### JDK (Java Development Kit)

* JRE + compiler + development tools
* Needed to **develop** Java programs

**Interview Line:**
JDK ⊃ JRE ⊃ JVM

---

## 3) Why Java Is Platform Independent

* Java source code is compiled into bytecode
* Bytecode runs on any JVM
* JVM is platform dependent, Java code is not

Hence:
**“Write once, run anywhere”**

---

## 4) main() Method – Why It Looks Strange

```java
public static void main(String[] args)
```

### Breakdown

* `public` → JVM must access it
* `static` → no object creation needed
* `void` → JVM does not expect a return value
* `String[] args` → command-line arguments

**Interview Trap:**
`main` can be overloaded, but JVM only calls this exact signature.

---

## 5) Memory Basics (Foundation Only)

### Stack Memory

* Method calls
* Local variables
* Faster
* Follows LIFO

### Heap Memory

* Objects
* Instance variables
* Shared across methods

For now, just remember this.
We will go deep later.

## 6) Java Version Reality (Interview-Oriented)

You do not need to memorize all Java versions.

What matters:

* Core Java concepts (Java 8+ mindset)
* OOP
* Collections
* Basic Streams

Interviewers test **understanding**, not version history.

---

## 7) Java in Interviews vs Java in DSA

### Interviews

* Concept clarity
* “Why” questions
* OOP depth

### DSA

* Speed
* Clean logic
* Correct data structure usage

This roadmap balances both.

---

## Phase 0 Summary

You should now be clear about:

* How Java runs
* JVM vs JRE vs JDK
* Platform independence
* Role of `main`
* Stack vs Heap (intro)
* Java’s role in interviews and DSA

---

## Phase 0 – Exercises (Mandatory)

Answer in your **own words**:

1. Why is Java not 100% compiled?
2. Why must `main` be static?
3. Can Java run without JVM?
4. Difference between JDK and JRE?
5. Where are objects stored?
