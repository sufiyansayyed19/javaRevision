    "The object lifecycle describes **what happens to an object** from the moment it is created until it becomes eligible for garbage collection.\n",

    "1. Class loading\n",
    "2. Object creation\n",

    "## 9. Common Interview Traps\n",
    "\n",
    "1. `obj = null` does not destroy object immediately\n",
    "2. GC is not guaranteed to run\n",

    "Does garbage collection free stack memory?\n",

    "Can we force garbage collection? Why?\n",

    "Answer:\n",
    "No. We can only request garbage collection using `System.gc()` or `Runtime.gc()`, but the JVM decides whether and when to run it.\n",

    "What makes an object eligible for garbage collection?\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer:\n",
    "An object becomes eligible for garbage collection when it is unreachable, meaning no active reference from stack, static variables, or threads points to it.\n",

    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Exercise 4\n",
    "\n",
    "Why is `finalize` not reliable?\n",

    "Answer:\n",
    "Because its execution is not guaranteed by the JVM, it may never be called, and it has been deprecated due to unpredictability and performance issues.\n",
