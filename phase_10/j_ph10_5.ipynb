    "# **PHASE 10 – Java 8+ Features**\n",
    "\n",
    "We will move **slow, structured, and interview-focused**.\n",
    "No assumptions beyond what you explicitly allowed.\n",

    "## **Phase 10.0 – Why Java 8 Was Introduced**\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Concept explanation (from zero level)\n",
    "\n",
    "Before Java 8, Java was:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Strongly **object-oriented**\n",
    "* Verbose for simple logic\n",
    "* Poor at **functional-style programming**\n",
    "* Weak for **bulk data processing** (especially collections)\n",
    "\n",
    "Example pre-Java 8 problem:\n",
    "\n",
    "> “Apply an operation to every element of a list, then filter some elements.”\n",
    "\n",
    "This required:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Explicit loops\n",
    "* Temporary collections\n",
    "* Boilerplate code\n",
    "\n",
    "Java 8 introduced **functional programming concepts** to solve this.\n",
    "\n",
    "Core goals of Java 8:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Reduce boilerplate code\n",
    "2. Make collection processing easier\n",
    "3. Enable **declarative programming**\n",
    "4. Improve readability and maintainability\n",
    "5. Prepare Java for **multi-core CPUs**\n",
    "\n",
    "Java 8 did **not replace OOPS**\n",
    "It **augmented OOPS with functional features**\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. What changed in Java 8 (high level)\n",
    "\n",
    "Java 8 introduced:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Functional Interfaces**\n",
    "2. **Lambda Expressions**\n",
    "3. **Streams API**\n",
    "4. **Method References**\n",
    "5. **Optional**\n",
    "6. Default & static methods in interfaces (support feature)\n",
    "\n",
    "These work together — **not independent topics**.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Interview framing (VERY IMPORTANT)\n",
    "\n",
    "Interviewers are NOT testing syntax.\n",
    "\n",
    "They test:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Why Java needed Java 8\n",
    "* When to use streams vs loops\n",
    "* Understanding of functional interfaces\n",
    "* Ability to read and reason about lambda code\n",
    "* Performance and memory implications\n",
    "\n",
    "If you cannot explain **why Java 8 exists**, your answers look shallow.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. Programming style shift\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Pre-Java 8 (Imperative style)\n",
    "\n",
    "You tell Java **how** to do things.\n",
    "\n",
    "```java\n",
    "for (int i = 0; i < list.size(); i++) {\n",
    "    if (list.get(i) > 10) {\n",
    "        result.add(list.get(i));\n",
    "    }\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Java 8+ (Declarative style)\n",
    "\n",
    "You tell Java **what** you want.\n",
    "\n",
    "```java\n",
    "list.stream()\n",
    "    .filter(x -> x > 10)\n",
    "    .collect(Collectors.toList());\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This is the philosophical shift.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. DSA relevance\n",
    "\n",
    "Java 8 helps in:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Cleaner traversal logic\n",
    "* Sorting with Comparator\n",
    "* Filtering and mapping data\n",
    "* Writing expressive code\n",
    "\n",
    "But:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Streams are **not always faster**\n",
    "* In tight loops, **classic loops may be better**\n",
    "* Interviews expect **judgment**, not blind usage\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 6. Internal working (high-level)\n",
    "\n",
    "Java 8 features are implemented using:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Anonymous classes\n",
    "* Bytecode-level optimizations\n",
    "* Lazy evaluation (streams)\n",
    "* Functional interfaces as contracts\n",
    "\n",
    "We will go deeper in later sub-phases.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 7. Interview traps\n",
    "\n",
    "1. “Java 8 made Java functional”\n",
    "   ❌ Wrong — Java is still object-oriented\n",
    "\n",
    "2. “Streams replace loops”\n",
    "   ❌ Wrong — they complement loops\n",
    "\n",
    "3. “Lambda expressions are methods”\n",
    "   ❌ Wrong — they are implementations of functional interfaces\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 8. Mandatory understanding checkpoint\n",
    "\n",
    "You must be clear that:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Java 8 = **functional + OOPS**\n",
    "* Functional interfaces are the foundation\n",
    "* Lambdas and streams sit on top of them\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## **Next Sub-Phase**\n",
    "\n",
    "### 👉 **Phase 10.1 – Functional Interfaces**\n",
    "\n",
    "This is the **most important foundation** of Java 8.\n",
    "Nothing else makes sense without this.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will cover:\n",
    "\n",
    "* What is a functional interface\n",
    "* Why it exists\n",
    "* `@FunctionalInterface`\n",
    "* Built-in functional interfaces\n",
    "* Interview traps\n",
    "* Internal behavior\n",
