    "## Exercise 1\n",
    "\n",
    "Why is heap divided into generations?\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer:\n",
    "Because most objects are short-lived. Dividing the heap into generations allows the JVM to collect short-lived objects frequently and cheaply, improving overall garbage collection performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Exercise 2\n",
    "\n",
    "Difference between Minor GC and Full GC.\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer:\n",
    "Minor GC cleans the Young Generation and is fast and frequent, while Full GC cleans the entire heap (Young + Old) and is slow, expensive, and causes longer application pauses.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Exercise 3\n",
    "\n",
    "How can memory leaks occur in Java despite GC?\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer:\n",
    "Memory leaks occur when objects are no longer needed logically but are still referenced, such as through static references, unremoved listeners, growing collections, or improper use of HashMap keys.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Exercise 4\n",
    "\n",
    "Why is Metaspace better than PermGen?\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer:\n",
    "Metaspace grows dynamically based on system memory and avoids the fixed-size limitation of PermGen, reducing class-loading related OutOfMemoryErrors.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Exercise 5\n",
    "\n",
    "What causes stop-the-world pauses?\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer:\n",
    "Stop-the-world pauses occur when the JVM temporarily halts all application threads to perform garbage collection or other critical JVM operations.\n",
