    "\n",
    "* Parallel execution\n",
    "* Better CPU utilization\n",
    "* Improved performance and responsiveness\n",

    "Key idea:\n",
    "Multiple threads execute independently within the same process and share memory.\n",

    "## Exercise 1\n",
    "\n",
    "Difference between `start()` and `run()`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer:\n",
    "`start()` creates a new thread and invokes `run()` internally, while calling `run()` directly executes the method in the current thread without creating a new thread.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Exercise 2\n",
    "\n",
    "Why is `Runnable` preferred over `Thread`?\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer:\n",
    "Because it allows multiple inheritance, separates task logic from thread management, and promotes better object-oriented design.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Exercise 3\n",
    "\n",
    "What is a race condition?\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer:\n",
    "A race condition occurs when multiple threads access and modify shared data simultaneously, leading to inconsistent or incorrect results due to lack of synchronization.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Exercise 4\n",
    "\n",
    "Does `sleep()` release lock?\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer:\n",
    "No.\n",
    "`Thread.sleep()` pauses the current thread but does not release any locks it holds.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Exercise 5\n",
    "\n",
    "Why must `wait()` be called inside a synchronized block?\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer:\n",
    "Because `wait()` releases the lock on the object, and the thread must own that lock before it can release it; otherwise, an `IllegalMonitorStateException` is thrown.\n"
